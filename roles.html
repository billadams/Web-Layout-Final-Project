			<h2>Character Roles</h2>
			<p>There are three main roles in Elder Scrolls Online: Tank, Healer, and Damage (commonly know as <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>). Most groups consist of a one Tank, one Healer, and two DPS.</p>
			<h3>Tank</h3>

			<p>A tank's main responsiblity is to taunt and maintain aggro of bosses and the more powerful monsters you'll find in the overworld and dungeons. As a tank generally has more health and utilizes heavy armor along with a shield, they are able to block and absorb more damage than other roles. A good tank positions monsters and faces them away from the rest of the group whenever possible. This reduces the chance that a monster's damage dealing abilities will hit the rest of the group. Besides blocking and taking the brunt of the damage, and since a tank is always right in the face of enemies, tanks interrupt enemy spells whenever the chance arises.
			<h3>Healer</h3>

			<p>A healer's job is just that, to heal the group. A healer helps keep the group alive either by <abbr title="Healing over Time">HoT</abbr> or direct healing abilities. Prior to any engagement, it's a good idea for a healer to cast a <abbr title="Healing over Time">HoT</abbr> ability before you start taking damage and then use a direct heal ability whenever a party member needs health. Using a <abbr title="Healing over Time">HoT</abbr> ability prior to an engagement and then recasting it before the original casting wears off ensures the best healing per magicka usage. Direct healing abilities return more health but at the cost of greater magicka usage.</p>
			<p>As healer, you also do damage when you're not healing, as well as debuffing and buffing when you can. As a basic rule of thumb, if you're not healing, you're doing damage. You can't heal an enemy to death.</p>
			<h3><abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr></h3>
			<img src="http://placehold.it/250x250">
			<p>Damage dealers have the job of prioritizing specific targets. Depending on the encounter, this may mean cleaning up lesser monsters prior to engaging a boss, or solely focusing on the boss and ignoring the lesser monsters. Again, it just depends on the engagement at hand. Damage dealers should avoid engaging multiple monsters at a time otherwise the healer will have to spend more resources keeping them alive. Also if the healer is getting attacked by multiple monsters and is using up a lot of their resources, a damage dealer should eliminate the monsters attacking the healer. It is also generally the damage dealers job to resurrect downed teammates and to not get tunnel vision during a fight. Be aware of your surroundings and the status of your teammates. You can't do any damage if you're dead.</p>
